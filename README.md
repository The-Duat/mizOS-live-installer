# mizOS-live-installer
Live ISO Installer for mizOS

**This repository is a live installation script for the Nile Integrated Linux Environment on an Arch Linux live ISO. This was made when the Nile was still treated as a seperate Linux distribution (mizOS) rather than a system management framework. It is no longer maintained or supported.**
